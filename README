cool_faces
==========

about
-----

=> generate cool ASCII slash Unicode faces <=

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This crate is derived from the cool-ascii-faces package[0] from Max Odgen 
and friends.

usage
-----

To return any random face, just call `face`. This replicates the original
package's API, e.g.

    cool_faces::face()

You can do better though! If you want to express a specific emotion, there
are plenty to choose from. You'll receive a single face from a fairly long
list of random options.

    cool_faces::angry()        -> "(ಠ_ಠ)", "(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻", ...
    cool_faces::confused()     -> "٩◔̯◔۶",  ...
    cool_faces::disappointed() -> "¬_¬", ...
    cool_faces::excited()      -> "ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ" ,  ..
    cool_faces::happy()        -> "=^.^=", ...
    cool_faces::meh()          -> "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯" , ...
    cool_faces::sad()          -> "༼ ºل͟º ༽", ...
    cool_faces::deal_with_it() -> "(⌐■_■)"
